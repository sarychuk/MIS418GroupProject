    <p>
        Previously, all materials and workshops were offered in person with no web 
        access. To offer convenience to clients Back On Course has built a web-solution 
        to sell and deliver products, workshops and E-Courses through the internet. This 
        will help improve the efficiency and profitability of safety companies. Safety 
        companies can host their products on Back on Course’s web solution to allow 
        their clients to shop with ease and convenience. Back on Course, Ltd. cares a 
        great deal about its clients and their security. All online transactions occur 
        over a secure network.</p>
